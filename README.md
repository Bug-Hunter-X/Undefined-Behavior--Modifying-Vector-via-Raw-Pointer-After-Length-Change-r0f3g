This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Rust involving undefined behavior. The bug arises from modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer after the vector's length or capacity has been changed. The example showcases how to misuse raw pointers and why using safe abstractions is preferable. The solution demonstrates the correct usage of vectors avoiding raw pointers.
